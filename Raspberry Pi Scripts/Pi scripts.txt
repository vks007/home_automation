# To enable shutdown and restart of the Pi via a momentary button do the following:
# install a momentary on button between GPIO3 (Pin 5) and GND on the Pin
# Add the following line in the file /boot/config.txt and you're done
# on every press of the button it will either shutdown or restart depending on the current state

# CHANGES TO /BOOT/CONFIG.TXT

# Enable shutting down of Pi using GPIO3 (Pin 5)
dtoverlay=gpio-shutdown

# To enable showing if the Pi is ON or not:
# connect a LED between GPIO15 and GND with a 330 ohm limiting resistor
#Turn ON LED on GPIO15 to indicate the Pi is ON , it turns OFF when Pi is shutdown
